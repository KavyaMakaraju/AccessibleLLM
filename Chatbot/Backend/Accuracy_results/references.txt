Human: This is Lincoln Bank , Consumer Credit Department . How can I help you ? 
Reference:  Ah , hello . I'm calling to find out how I apply for a car loan . 
Human:  We offer a Personal Automobile Consumer Loan . The application process is pretty straight forward . I trust you have enough funds to cover the 20 % down payment ? 
Reference:  Yes , I do . It's ready and waiting in my account . 
Human:  The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... 
Reference:  Could I just stop you there ? Sorry to interrupt , but I have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car I want . 
Human:  That will certainly cut down the processing time . We can move on to the next step . Do you have the purchase price ? 
Reference:  Yes , it's 110,000 RIB . So , with the down payment done , I will need to borrow 70,000 RIB . 
Human:  What we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , ID card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment . 
Reference:  Yes , I have everything here . OK , I'll come in and see you later today . Maybe I could have my new car as early as next week ! How exciting !

Conversation 50:
Human: What do you think of our price ? 
Reference:  Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 
Human:  Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . 
Reference:  I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . 
Human:  I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . 
Reference:  I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . 
Human:  I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . 
Reference:  Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? 
Human:  We've already cut down our price to cost level . 
Reference:  Is that all ? 
Human:  Yes , this is the best we can do . 
Reference:  I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
