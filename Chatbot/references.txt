205:  Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? 
206:  I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . 
207:  I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . 
208:  Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? 
209:  Is that all ? 
210:  I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered .
